Attention! This project requires OpenSSL to be installed!

Required to run!
1. After running the .pro file, move the contents of the "resources" folder to the "build" folder
2. Specify the path to the encrypted "data.bin.enc" in the command line parameters

So, this is my project for submitting a 1st year coursework in my program at the University. It is a console application for working with a simple migration database and includes:
1. Basics of working with the C++ programming language and its libraries
2. The OOP paradigm and dividing functions into classes
3. Simple encryption via OpenSSL and functions for encrypting and decrypting a file containing a database
4. Functions for working with a database: editing the necessary lines, as well as adding and deleting them
5. Functions for sorting and searching the database for the necessary records by certain criteria

This is my first full-fledged experience working with a C++ project, if you do not take into account the many practical works I wrote during my year of study at the university. I got an unforgettable experience working with this programming language and learned its basics, as well as the basics of working with simple encryption.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! Have a nice day!
